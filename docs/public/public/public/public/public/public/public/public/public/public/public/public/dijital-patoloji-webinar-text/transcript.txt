and our speaker Juan welcome I gave my thanks at the party you couldn't understand instruction is you can go from now on together I shared your CVA with the audiences and everyone knows you so very well you were one of the pioneer groups in digital pathology in Granada University and you were fully digitalized in 2016. it is it's the history for digital pathology and now you are the medical uh director of page the first FDA approach AI algorithm so amazing and exciting so it is my great pleasure to welcome you to see you with uh with us with Turkish Pathologists engineers and a lot of other people interested in digital pathology so it will be so good to listen to your digital pathology experience and the stage is yours please one welcome thank you thank you so very much illness for the lovely introduction I mean you made you made it sound a lot more exciting that what it really is in in reality but but I hope that you find you know the story well worth listening to and you find information that is helpful to you so so yeah my name is is Juan de tamero I'm an anatomical pathologist and um I was I was very very fortunate to be at the right time at the right place and essentially that is one of the first laps in in Europe really and probably in the world to have come fully digital for primary diagnosis so from that point onwards my career really changed from that of a you know diagnostic pathologies to that into a consultant in in digital transformation which is what I've been doing uh ever since really since uh 2017 really so yeah almost almost six seven years ago and I was very fortunate to join page uh two and a half years as a medical vice president really but today today I'm not here to give you an account of what page does as a company today I'm wearing my cup as a pathologist and I would like to share with you my experiences as to how to go digital because of course you know the idea is that we would like to modernize pathology we would like to implement artificial intelligence but you have to follow a series of steps series of steps that involve the digital transformation of your lab before you can actually Implement artificial intelligence so so yeah I would like to thank you all for your attention we'd like to thank you Mina for uh you know for the invitation would like also to thank the turkey Society of pathology for having me here today and of course Memorial Hospitals for for inviting me to uh to share my experiences with you and essentially this is this is a brief Outlook of the things that I would like to discuss with you today you know my personal experiences we're also going to talk about the reasons why pathology should be modernized because at the end of the day pathology is a profession under strain it's a profession under stressed and we need to realize that every every help that we can get from technology should be welcome with open arms however there is a series of you know steps that we need to follow as we mentioned earlier we need to adopt digital pathology at large if we want to modernize the profession and finally Embrace artificial intelligence a lot of pathologies feel somewhat threatened by artificial intelligence and what that means but at the end of the day we should not be afraid I don't think there are any reasons for us to be afraid of embracing the new technology because the technology is here to help us do a better job more efficiently but also that job will reflect on the quality of the diagnosis we make for ourselves but more importantly for our patients I'm here to give you a balanced account of what going digital means so we're going to talk about the things that Pathologists like about the going digital but also the things that Pathologists do not like about going digital so a lot of all of these you know accounts that need to be followed if we want to successfully transform our Laboratory um so first of all let me kick off giving you a brief introduction of Granada University Hospitals because essentially this is the place I was working when uh we undertook the digital transformation of our Center so Granada hospitals is basically formed by four different hospitals that you can see here in this map in the south of the Iberian Peninsula in in Spain so the city center of Granada is covered by two teaching hospitals which amongst them have approximately 1 500 beds and in addition to that we have two peripheral rural hospitals that are between 75 and 100 kilometers separated from the main Central hub so the idea was that the the the biopsy on the specimen processing for the city of Granada was actually centralized in the central hospital that we see here in the picture whereas each one of the peripheral hospitals had their their own individual uh uh pathology Labs who basically process uh you know the specimens the overall overall the catchment area was around 1 million inhabitants because of course bear in mind that this is Spanish public health care so it's fully owned by the government so no private initiative in this regard everything was paid for for uh with public money to provide a Public Service public health care in southern Spain so on the whole there was 2 000 hospital beds almost 2 000 hospital beds um which basically translated into about 65 000 specimens per year and by that we mean histopathologist pathology nothing of the kind of cytopathology Etc and that is important because cytology cannot be digitized for the time being but everything else everything that was not cytology certainly we digitized and we successfully transformed to a digital worker in addition to that Granada hospital was staffed by 23 Pathologists and about 50 histo technicians and as we mentioned earlier we completed the digital transformation of our operations back in September 2016. so almost almost six seven years ago actually and on the whole the transition period was about about four months so in a nutshell how can we summarize the experience of having gone digital so our experience is basically summarized in in these two papers that I would like to share with you they are available in archives the the free access so I would definitely encourage you to download it and take a look at them they're free so definitely packed with information so I would definitely encourage you to uh to take a look at them on the whole the experience with digital pathology as far as we are concerned translated into significant deficiency gains once we implemented the digital transformation um and that came largely because we could definitely allocate cases more efficiently across the network of hospitals that we discussed in the previous slide so essentially cases now once they were fully digital could be sent to the right pathologies regardless of where this Pathologists happen to be across our geography and that in itself translated largely in significant efficiency against that we measure around 20 year after year following the digital transformation in addition to that we also conducted a satisfaction survey survey across our pathologist and the experience of our Pathologists is that the digital workflow was a more pleasant environment in which to work the digital workflow also translated in improved quality of the diagnosis in other words pathologies felt that the quality of the diagnosis they were providing was significantly better than that on the microscope and afterwards nobody wanted to go back to the analog workflow in other words once you try digital pathology you don't want to go back to the microscope to the analog workflow so this can be a good summary really of our experience at Granada University Hospitals after having having transitioned from glass to full digital world so let us look at the reasons as to why pathology should be modernized because of course we can say well you know the microscope is cheap the microscope is efficient and the microscope Works we're hugely experienced in the use of uh light microscopy so why why should it be modernized let's look at a series of numbers a series of reasons why pathologies should be modernized and essentially this paper that was published some years ago takes a look at the trend in terms of the number of pathologies compared to what the medical disciplines so we can see how the numbers of anesthesiologists and Radiologists basically keep scraping up however the number of pathologies is actually decreasing due to retirements that do not get replaced by new trainees coming into the profession more worriedly what we do see is that the number of cancer specimens certainly in the United States and Canada keeps creeping up so in other words what we do have is a situation whereby we have more work to do increasing number of cancerous specimens but a decreasing number of pathologies actually to deal with these cases to be able to face the challenges of these oncology patients that require laborious and complex diagnosis and you know this is something that is not unique uh to the United States and Canada something that happens in the majority of of the western world um and obviously you know this report from the Royal College of Pathologists from the United Kingdom essentially you know summarizes that only three percent of histopathology departments across the United Kingdom have sufficient stuff to meet their clinical needs so in other words pathology is is a profession under stress because essentially there is more work to do more complex reports to elaborate pertaining with cancer specimens but a decreasing number of pathologies to cope with this challenge but essentially you know that is largely the reason because a lot of what pathologies have to do consists of finding needles in haystacks if you think about you know the work that pathologies do with prostatic needle biopsy diagnosis that is largely looking for very small things that may or may not be left so very similar to looking for for needles in Haystack something similar happens in uh you know assessment of lymph nodes in patients with breast cancer so this could be challenging could be time consuming could be slow and unfortunately pathologies are only human beings and that means that you know we inevitably make mistakes and I think you know this these papers these pieces of evidence published in the literature try to summarize you know the problems associated with prostatic corneal biopsy especially these three papers here so we know that the false negative rate of diagnosis wrong diagnosis uh by Pathologists doing uh assessment of needle biopsies in prostate can be you know as high as you know around two to three percent according to the literature also we know that a number of specimens in the pathology Labs actually have complications and that is largely due to samples that get misplaced samples that get swapped between patients samples that get contaminated by DNA from other samples etc etc etc so for these reasons um you know every help that we can get from technology to help us minimize these risks to help us minimize these false negatives should be embraced with open arms because you know at the end of the day what we want to avoid at all cost is that situation on a population level where we come across you know uh headlines in the Press like this where essentially you know the Press publicizes you know the fact that you know portfolios are human beings and you know we all make mistakes and obviously you know that can be can have you know severe and very tragic consequences for patients so technology as as we will see later on can help us minimize this risk and for that reason due to the stress that we as uh submitted to as a profession we should embrace the technology to help us minimize this risk and to help us minimize situations like that that they see on the screen

so essentially um today artificial intelligence has proven that we can actually reduce the number of false negative errors particularly false negative errors committed by Pathologists and this is something that was reflected in this article that we published last year and essentially publishes the results of a clinical trial that led to the approval of the first artificial intelligence tool in pathology that was basically a prostate algorithm and the idea here is that the algorithm itself

in itself has the value but the most important idea is that the combination of pathologies together with artificial intelligence improve the performance of Pathologists so in other words artificial intelligence is not here to diagnose autonomously these cases rather than that but the role of technology is essentially to help Pathologists do a more efficient job to a more accurate job when it comes to diagnosing this this specimens and as we can see when aided by the technology Pathologists made 70 fewer errors than when the pathologies are not aided by the technology let me give you additional examples as to the impact that the technology can also have in other areas that Pathologists do day in and day out like you know assessment of Sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer so essentially these articles you know that were published many years ago I mean this is this is nothing new I mean some of them were publish uh more than 10 years ago and but they're still very valid today and the idea is that we have sub-optimal agreement when assessing metastasis that are small metastases that present low volume in breast cancer and of course this can potentially have a significant impact when it comes to assessing the end staging of patients with breast cancer this article that was also published you know more than 10 years ago again highlights the fact that when a group of Specialists reviews the nodal stage of patients with breast cancer that have been primarily diagnosed by generalists this expert pathologist usually end up upstaging increasing the end status of these of these patients and the number of patients that suffered that is around a quarter of them so in other words around a quarter of patients diagnosed by General Pathologists actually should have an increase in status when they're reviewed by a specialist in other words pathology is a human being it's inevitable that we miss you know especially small things things that are challenging to detect small fossil of cancer in Middle biopsies small micromeds that are easy to miss and potentially can affect the end staging and potentially the treatment of those patients as we see in this in this paper that was published you know some time ago but again similar to what we saw earlier on in in prostate we see that some when aided by the by the technology Pathologists can actually perform a much better job aided by artificial intelligence than we're not alone and you know the chameleon challenge that again you know was was published some years ago highlights this so essentially one Pathologists which are the group that we see here the orange dot that we see here when Pathologists look at lymph node biopsies without the aid of uh technology and with time constraints they do a job that is not less than less than perfect the Green Dot that we see here represents a pathologist who is a breast specialist but has no time constraints unlike the rest of the Pathologists who basically had time constraint much like we do have in clinical practice in real world practice but when pathologies who are Specialists do not have any time constraints they do an almost perfect job but that is unfortunately not the case when the pathology is under time pressure and what the pathologies are not necessarily A specialists in in breast pathology the lines that we see here actually correspond with artificial intelligence tools so the point of the matter the point of this study is that some tools can actually do as good as a job as a pathologist and a specialist and has no time constraint but again the main point here is that pathologies are not going to be replaced by technology but rather Pathologists should embrace the technology because it will help them be more efficient more accurate and overall to provide a better quality diagnosis done with the pathologies are not created by this novel technology right so moving on so we've seen that you know these are the reasons why we should embrace artificial intelligence pathology is under stress we have less people to do more work and you know cancer diagnosis keeps getting more complex every day so artificial intelligence is here to help us tackle this challenge but how do we get there how if we want to implement artificial intelligence what are the steps that we need to follow and essentially the first step that we need to follow will be to optimize the workflow because at the end of the day digital pathology is very reliant on the quality of the histology so once we have optimized our workflow once we have optimized our histology the next step is the it integration between the laboratory information system the Lis and the tracking software together with the digital pathology elements with that in mind we can then Implement digital pathology and deties the entirety ideally the entirety of our workload and only then we can Implement artificial intelligence so these are the steps that we need to follow successively so first of all optimizing our histology in order to be able to integrate the Lis and the IIT infrastructure before we can fully Implement digital pathology and only then we can then Implement artificial intelligence at a clinical scale so what do we mean by improving the workflow so essentially uh you know one of the key elements one of the key source of errors that we see in digital pathology Labs is the fact that QR codes do not always get properly read by the digital pathology scanners and that is largely the case because the labels get contaminated get stained during their pre-analytical during the staining process which means that the QR code is not always visible so we have to address that problem and we have to ensure that the QR codes are of the best possible quality and you know sometimes even may be necessary to replace the printers to make sure that the QR codes are of the top quality because at the end of the day you know these are the unique identifiers for each slide so whenever the slide obtains a digital replica of that slide it will be assigned to the right patient onto the right case and for that reason the QR code is is essential more problems that we do see essentially pertain you know how the slides are prepared so that slide that we see here with the overhanging cover slipper in the microscope this is not a big problem because you know in the microscope you know these overhanging glass bead here and there will not create any major problems but if we were to put this slide on the digital pathology scanner the scanner may have problems digitizing this slide because the slides need to be really really well prepared the the scope slips need to be really well aligned with the main glass in order to not interfere with the mechanical elements of the scanner things like bubbles in glass in the glass slide again you know in the microscope this is relatively straightforward to navigate but the digital pathology scanners do not have that luxury and that means that this can lead to artifacts that may render you know the slide not legible by by the pathologist things like this obviously for a pathologist um you know who who is delivered this slide is very easy to just separate these two slides in in into the individual ones but if we put this into digital pathologies scanner this could potentially Jam the scanner so again you know we need to be really really cognizant that these slides obviously are not suitable to be put into a scanner and that can potentially create significant problems and even jump the scanner another typical problem is essentially you know Mountain media glue basically using on the sides of the slides again this is very easy to navigate with the microscope but if we put this slide inside a scanner this can potentially create problems and I can tell you that um you know in our institution we definitely have problems with these kind of slides so one of the cover sleepers actually produce significant amounts of glue and whenever we put these lights into the scanner that broke the scanner a number of times and that essentially triggered Panic emergency visits from the technicians from the scanning manufacturer company to our lab in order to do a full cleanup of the scanner etc etc which means that the scan had to be uh you know in downtime for repairs and obviously that is what you want to avoid at all cost if you're digitizing your slides every day single day and day out so very important that the slides are nice and dry rid of any excess of multimedia and can be put into the scanner safely without creating any major problems so at the end of the day the digital workflow largely requires a digital pathology scanner whose mission at the end of the day is to obtain a digital stream a digital replica of the glass slide so the glass light is for the most part prepare the same way it's always been prepared with the with exception that we just discussed and the job of the scanner is to create this digital twin this digital replica in that in that sequence the QR code is Paramount and that is the reasons why we discussed earlier that having good quality QR codes is essential if we want to digitize large number of our glass slides on the other end of the spectrum what we do see is the viewer and essentially the viewer what it does is to replace the pathologist however the job of the viewer is is basically to replace the microscope but it's not to organize the workflow because essentially the role of organizing the workflow corresponds to the laboratory information system and this is why the integration between all of these elements is Paramount whenever a slide gets detached the Lis gets triggered and gets triggered by the QR code and essentially that new digital image that has been created has to be assigned to the right patient and to the right case and that is a function of the Lis whenever the pathologist request new techniques on a certain case like you are the immunostains your other levels you order additional techniques that information goes back to the lies which in return should be should be feedback to the digital pathology system waiting for these new techniques to be uh to be created in other words the interaction between these three elements is key in a digital pathology element so this is why all of these elements between you know the I.T infrastructure and the pre-analytical need to come together to facilitate the digital viewing of the images and the the eventual suppression of the analog workflow and substitution for the digital world

right challenges that we may encounter in this process so obviously the main challenge that we have discussed is the QR code they have to be of the top quality for the reasons that we mentioned so essentially it is imperative that the QR codes are of the maximum maximum possible quality in order to minimize this kind of errors sometimes changing the printers may be required and certainly in some institutions that I have worked with they needed to change the Printers in order to minimize the risk of you know the QR codes not being ideal also the question of the cover slips needs to be addressed because again it's important that the cover sleep is perfectly aligned with the main glass slide in order to minimize the risk of them interfering with the mechanical elements of the scanner and certainly in a number of Institutions that I work with we have strongly suggested that perhaps film coffee sleeping should be employed because at the end of the day film cover slips um you know they always align perfectly well with the glass slide they dry up fairly quickly they do not live in a rescue in terms of glue etc etc they get dry very quickly and are suitable to be put in the scanner very very quickly another element to bear in mind is the batch versus continuous workflow so let me explain to you what I mean by that so in most pathology labs around the world we follow a batch approach what we what we mean by that is that a large number of glass slides is produced at once and those glass slides get put into the scanner to be scanned one at a time the problem here is that the digital pathology scanners can only read a single glass slide at a time so essentially the the scanning process creates a huge bottleneck here where all of the slides get put in the queue waiting for them to be digitized one slide at a time but the problem is that the scanner sits unused for long periods of time waiting for this very large batch of glass lights to come to the digital pathology scanner can we find an alternative to this approach is there a better alternative to this and the answer is basically to find a continuous workflow by continuous workflow but what we mean by that is that small batches get sent to the scanner time after time so the scanner instead of being sitting and use gets actually used around the clock so the scanner is almost always scanning so first batch first then the second batch next and then the third patch next so in other words we migrate from a batch approach where you know the scanner is basically not being used and all of a sudden a large batch of slides gets delivered as opposed to a situation whereby you know the scan is always continuously in use thanks to small batches that get delivered almost constantly so definitely whenever possible a continuous workflow is a much better alternative because it maximizes the amount of scanning time that we can put to our scanner obviously the alternative to this would be to buy more scanners but of course you know buying scan is expensive and sometimes it makes sense to opt for a continuous workflow approach

another problem that we face you know fairly frequently is the integration with the Lis so we discussed earlier that you know the integration between the I.T infrastructure is Paramount and the reason for that is that we need to be able to uh find that you know the Lis system is always in charge of the workflow and this is what we call an Lis Centric versus an image Centric approach so the reason for that is that the Lis is always like the conductor in the orchestra so whenever we request an additional staying in a case the Lis is notified and this notification gets feedback to the digital pathology scanner to the digital pathology element

um another reason is that you know the case status is essentially a function of the Lis and this is important because again you know whenever I update a case because I request additional stains I do that on the Lis and this has to be reflected on the digital pathology platform so again it's the bilateral interaction between the Lis and the digital pathology platform which actually facilitates uh you know the application of the continuous workflow in pathology

right so those are the foundations for digital pathology we discussed that you know the workflow needs to be modified we discuss also that the it infrastructure needs to be bilaterally in connection with each other so the case status uh can be basically uh interchange uh for all the slides that get digitized but once we achieve full digital pathology what is it that Pathologists like about digital pathology and the first thing that Pathologists like about digital pathology is the quality of the images at low power so let's imagine that we're reviewing this fragment of tissue on the microscope so usually the minimum possible power that you can get on your microscope is 2.5 x however on the digital pathology scanner you can go as low as 0.5 x which permits you to visualize all of the tissue present on the preparation at once so instead of having to navigate with a microscope up and down trying to visualize the entire piece of tissue pressing on the slide at low power on a digital pathology you can see at a glance the regions of interest that where you want to focus your attention but also the videos where you don't need to spend that much time because there are no obvious morphological areas that warrant an additional additional review so this is one of the key elements why Pathologists prefer the digital workflow essentially it's the quality of the low power images and at the end of the day as pathologies we spend the immense majority of our time looking at the slides at low power so this is certainly an area where digital pathology does better than the microscope another aspect is obviously measuring a tumor measuring the distance to margins measuring tumor thickness etc etc etc so imagine that we want to measure a melanoma for instance obviously this is how things are done around the world today so essentially we put a school ruler on the microscope stage we look through the binocular and this is what we see we see our lesion there and then we we estimate we we do our best with the tools that we have to assess you know the tumor thickness and to assess you know the distance to margins etc etc etc how is this song in the digital world front so obviously in a digital workflow you have digital tools that are definitely more accurate more elegant more precise when it comes to performing this task so obviously this is another uh you know the availability of digital tools is definitely very attractive to Pathologists because essentially uh you know it results at the end of the day in Greater quality and more efficient workflow when it comes to uh you know to perform these tasks again things like perhaps you know assessing the tumor burden in a prostatic corneal biopsy you can certainly do that using the detail tools although of course artificial intelligence can provide to you automatically all of these elements like you know total quantification of the overall invasive carcinoma burden on that core as well as the carcinoma length in addition to a breakdown of the different Gleason patterns present on that score and of course you know the idea is that this information would be interchanged and extracted to your Lis so whenever the pathologist opens up the case on the Lis all of this information is already written there in the report and that greatly facilitates the job of the pathologist so essentially the job of the pathologist is just to visualize what the AI is telling me if I agree with that just validate sign of the case and uh off to the next case so obviously you know that facilitates you know safety accuracy and of course efficiency because essentially you know it provides the majority of the legwork that the pathologies would have to do otherwise themselves another advantage of the digital workflow is that well if that is you know the number of slides produced by a lab in a typical day and you get a call from a clinician asking you about a certain patient well you know you're gonna have to spend some time going through that pile of cases looking for the particular case the particular slide that interests you in order to address the clinician who's actually on the other end of the phone so what you do more often than not is you know pick up the phone and tell the clinician listen can I ring you back in half an hour and what you do is spend the next half an hour looking for that particular case on that pile of glass slides with a digital workflow however what you do is actually you log into your digital pathology system you go into your search field that you can see here you type the patient details and the patient magically appears in front of you so therefore you can address the clinician queries pretty much on the Fly and without wasting time looking for glass slides that you know may or may not appear on a timely manner so a summary of the different advantages essentially is the good quality of low power images which at the glance permits the pathologist to visualize the entirety of a deletion the availability of different digital pathology tools that permits you know measuring the tumor thickness distance to margins etc etc another very cool tool is essentially the ability to split your screen in different quadrants so you can visualize the h e and a different of other techniques all at once so you can see how these techniques correlate in different regions of the same slide importantly once your workflow is 100 in detail that means that a series of uh workflows in the analog uh Paradigm become redundant which means that essentially no case sorting and distribution is needed in other words every day say your typical Pathology Lab for argument's sake produces around a thousand slides every day and that thousand slides have to be put in order to be collated by the technicians have to be matched with their request forms and have to be handy to the pathologist and that is done by persons by technicians all around the world which spend a significant amount of hours every single day doing that with digital pathology that process takes place automatically which means that the technicians no longer have to waste time doing case assembly and distribution but of course you have to be 100 digital to achieve that but obviously this is one of the benefits of digital pathology so the benefits is not just for pathologies but also reflects in other areas of the lab including how technicians work and of course you know the counterbalance to that is that technicians would have to operate the scanners but today you know the clinical grade scanners essentially do not require more than one full-time equivalent more than one person to actually operate because essentially there are scanners um designed to be high throughput which essentially means that they are capable of digitized large volumes of skin of of slides with relatively little human interaction so again the advantages of digital pathology not only pertain to Pathologists but also across uh other functions in the lab and again the vision is that artificial intelligence will help Pathologists largely identify the areas of tumor and also automate a significant part of the work that otherwise would be tedious and time consuming I I particularly like this tweet which was written by Lorna Cottrell who is a a Scottish pathologist um and it was written five years ago but essentially it relates to a situation that most of us can relate as pathologies and she says cannot wait for digital pathology because I wouldn't have just spent 40 minutes tilling my office apart looking for a glass light which was actually sitting on my microscope in other words glass lights get lost all the time because glass lights get broken glass lights get misplaced and we spend an incredible amount of time looking for glass slides that may or may not be there but of course once you go fully digital you know this problem becomes a thing of the past and this greatly adds to your working experience and greatly adds to your uh efficiency as a pathologist

and as I mentioned earlier you know this efficiency gains not only materialize to Pathologists but also to technicians because again you know if your lab produces a thousand slides every day they have to be put in order they have to be collated but of course once you have a digital pathology scanners the digital images automatically thanks to the interaction with lies with it infrastructure gets sent straight away to the right pathologist regardless of whether this pathologist happens to be at home in the hospital or in a distant remote site it doesn't matter anymore so all of this a significant impact on the operations of the lab overall and the question is right so how can we measure that impact and um is there a number of hours that we can estimate saving uh when a Pathology Lab has gone fully digital but essentially this paper that was published by lapong in the Netherlands uh some time ago estimates that the overall number of hours per day safe across the entire lab not just by the pathologist but also by technical staff and secretarial and clinical staff amounts overall to 19 hours per day saved by just working deeply so again you know the benefits do not just Encompass the pathologist but also you know all the associated professions across the lab when it comes to reading times you know some Pathologists feel a bit you know ambitious because they say well you know I'm very quick with my microscope am I going to be as quick reading deeply and this paper which was published you know several years ago actually uh reports 10 percent shorter reading times in digital compared to the microscope so in other words Pathologists can definitely read cases quicker when reading cases deeply and this evidence was actually uh supported Again by this paper which was published by lapon again another you know the same the same lab from the Netherlands was published uh earlier this year saying that on average there's a reduction in Reading times of around 12 percent when the Pathologists read their cases on a digital work so that is the instance that pathology is normally like about going digital so the workflow is more efficient the workflow is quicker you don't waste time looking for slides measuring tumors distance to margins Etc is quicker more efficient etc etc but again I'm not here to tell you you know the rosie Legend I'm also here to talk about you know things that Pathologists do not like about digital pathology because nothing in life is perfect and digital pathology is no exception right so what things do pathologies not do not like about digital pathology so the first thing is that we mentioned that image at low power looked better on digital compared to the microscope but the opposite is also true to high power images in other words high power images in digital have some level of pixelation that is not present on the optical microscope and the reason for that is that you know these images are normally scanned at 40x which means that when we go beyond 4tx we are digitally zooming into the image and we know what happens there that pixelation occurs in other words there is the same number of pixels created where we just blow in those pixels up trying to recreate higher magnification than that that was at which the image was originally acquired so essentially pixelation of occurs at very high powers an example of that would be you know in gastric biopsies for instance you know Finding helicopter can be a bit challenging I mean you know we can still see the bacteria we still see it there but suddenly it's not as clear it's not as sharp as it would be on the microscope so again you know low power images much better on digital but high power images still better on the microscope another situation is when looking for very small things bacterias we just saw but also mitosis that we see here perhaps you you may want to you know see that image with greater Clarity to discern whether that's going to be a mitosis or an apoptotic body but you know for the most part you know mitosis are fairly clear but again you know the images are definitely not as sharp as they would be on on the microscope so of course you know every time that we require to go above 40x we're gonna incur in some degree of a digital magnification which means that the pixels will start to get blurry if we go beyond 40x so that is the trade-off better quality in low power images and digital but not so good images as on the microscope when when we go high power but the question is as Pathologists we probably spend the majority of our time uh looking at low power work so on the whole probably the balance actually is beneficial for Pathologists because essentially we spend the majority of our time at you know 5x 20x 5 10 20x rather than but very high power another problem is mentality is psychology and essentially we refer to the fact that you know some pathologies uh usually the senior not always but typically the more senior Pathologists well you know they've been using the microscope for decades they're very confident in their diagnosis that very quick with the microscope but perhaps they're not so quick with with technology not so quick in a digital environment or using a computer or using even you know the mobile phone so you know suddenly you know these pathologies have to be managed uh with care and has have may have some difficulties that we have to address on an individual basis when we were doing a digital transformation in Granada in in Spain uh we had one of senior Pathologists whose name was Miguel and Miguel you know it was a very good pathologist incredibly talented you know very very good guy very good person extremely good colleague but he was very afraid of digital pathology and he did not like the idea of going digital so Miguel back in those days he was like Juan I like the idea of going digital but I'd rather stay with my microscope so can you not leave me on my microscope until I retire and uh yeah and spare me the pain and suffering of having to you know Embrace a digital pathology workflow which is something that I don't look forward to long story short is that Miguel was persuaded to try digital pathology so he tried it but he did not like it and he did not like it because the image that he saw in the digital pathology screen according to him was very different to what he saw on the microscope so he hated the YouTube pathology but Miguel told me one day Juan you know what I'm due for an eye test I have to go to the optician so I'll go to the optician and I'll get back to you so Miguel who hated digital pathology went to the optician he got new glasses new lenses and this is Miguel a few days later after trying his new glasses on the digital pathology environment in other words Miguel did not like digital pathology because he had a visual problem that had not been corrected whenever he had that visual problem corrected with the adequate glasses he was very comfortable using digital pathology the images that he saw on the screen were equivalent to those that he saw on the microscope so in other words some Pathologists will have some mental barriers that need to be overcome some of them also would have physical barriers that need to be addressed Miguel essentially needed a visit to the optician to get his vision tested and corrected and essentially Miguel retired being a happy digital pathologist and you know he loved digital pathology and he never really touched a microscope again you know in the short few years that he had until retirement and in fact you can probably see his microscope here at you know the bottom of the screen uh you know the microscope stage has a positive note on it which means that he really didn't use the microscope anymore after having gone to eat but of course there were a series of mental barriers mental and physicals that had to be had to be addressed before Miguel could actually use digital pathology proficiently so on the whole is it worth it coin digital is necessarily not cheap involves a series of efforts involves a series of challenges that have to be addressed in a multi-disciplinary team approach is it worth it so essentially to address that question we uh produce uh we did an efficiency analysis to try and measure the productivity and the efficiency of pathologies and compare that to the microscope workflow years after having gone deep so essentially in the year 2015 we had 24 pathologies who dealt with this number of cases which means that on average each pathologist dealt with this number of cases per year you have to bear in mind that you know this is actually cases that exclude cytology so cytology was not digitized but everything that was digitized so every case every histopathology case was actually digitized and essentially on the Baseline on the microscope before digitization that was the number of cases per pathologists what we do see is that year after year the number of cases per pathologies actually increase thanks largely to the digital transformation and we can see how this number this efficiency of pathologies increase 15 the first year 20 the second year 26 the following year so in other words since digital transformation on average the productivity the efficiency of pathologies actually Jump by 20 following uh the digital transformation and comparing workloads with the analog workflow

in addition to that we conducted a survey across our pathologies basically to gauge the level of satisfaction with the digital pathology did they like it did they hate it so we wanted to know that and we essentially conducted an anonymous survey to try and gauge you know the level of satisfaction with digital pathology so we asked the pathologist the first question which was how do you think your efficiency has changed following the digital pathology transformation and essentially Pathologists reported on average 20 increase in efficiency which is very similar to the numbers that we just discussed a minute ago the second thing how do you think digital pathology has affected the quality of your diagnosis and essentially almost 80 percent of all the battery is felt that the quality of the diagnosis was better done with the microscope for the reasons that we have discussed better tracking throughout the pre-analytical better preparation of the slides during the pre analytical availability of measuring tools that probably are more accurate than the analog tools etc etc so for all of these reasons the perception was that you know the quality of the diagnosis was better than that on the microscope with regards to home reporting obviously you know we did the digital transformation before the covet pandemic so back in those days before the pandemic about a quarter of the pathologist routinely signed out cases from home but obviously during the pandemic 100 of the Pathologists actually migrated to a home-based workflow with absolutely no problems because obviously the infrastructure had been there had been working forever since ages basically and essentially you know that the number of Pathologists routinely reported from home definitely jumped during the pandemic but also after the pandemic and the final question which was the million dollar question Islam essentially after trying digital pathology would you rather stay digital or would you go back to the microscope and essentially a hundred percent of the Pathologists prefer digital to the microscope so essentially no one of them wanted to touch a microscope again and on the whole I think this survey summarizes fairly well what's in it for Pathologists what are pathologists uh you know achieving by transforming the practice from analog to digital so it's actually it's better efficiency better quality of diagnosis more flexibility in terms of Home reporting and strong preference to continue working in a digital in a digital environment

so to start wrapping up my talk today I just like to Briefly summarize the points that we touch upon so as we've seen pathology start discipline under strain because essentially we have more cancer cases but diminishing number of pathologies to cope with this increase in workouts the technology that we use today which is the Microsoft has really not changed in 200 years and you know that puts limitations limitations on how well we find needles in Pay Stacks how well we cope with you know time pressure how well we cope you know with the increasing demands that oncology diagnosis actually places upon the pathologist so it's time that we definitely start embracing new technology that will open up new avenues of efficiency quality and safety for our patients in addition to that digital pathology and artificial intelligence are showing evidence of benefits you know in the papers that we discussed earlier on during my presentation but also importantly improve patient safety we do better for our patients we reduce the number of errors with the new technology so for all of these reasons I think you know that the technology should be embraced with open arms by pathologists in addition we've seen you know how a series of steps have to be followed starting with optimizing your workflow integrating your I.T infrastructure your lies and only when this Foundation is in place we can store start implementing digital pathology which in itself is a prerequisite to implementing artificial intelligence in in the routine work so as we've seen you know the slide preparation is essential the Lis interaction is another key piece and digital pathology in itself becomes the foundation of artificial intelligence so with that I would like to thank you all for your attention today and if time permits I would very glad to uh you know take any questions and indeed looking forward to the discussion so thanks very much again and yeah looking forward to your questions

yes

thank you Juan uh great talk so amazing there are some questions I I will introduce them to you uh can we take your email first question it's okay for you and Ibrahim kulach asks would you confidently claim that reading times are shorter for every specialty or or you think there would be differences would really like to hear your opinion experience on this yeah so so I mean would you can we say that every single pathologist would be 20 more efficient well not really some pathologies would be 30 more efficient some of them may maybe five percent slower that it's very dependent on individual factors of course but on average we can reasonably expect is that deficiency will go up does that mean that every case that I look digitally will be more quick than on the microscope not necessarily but on the whole the majority of the cases that you review digitally will be more efficient that is what we we considerly are certain if we look at some of the evidence that that I share earlier certainly not every case is quicker on detail compared to the microscope but on the whole the majority of cases are definitely quicker by about 10 quicker just by reading them digitally but in addition to that there is a series of advantages advantages like you know you probably are quicker taking measurements you don't waste time looking for slides you don't waste time matching your immunos with a corresponding case which is something that you do as a pathologist every single day of your career every day of your career you can deliver a slight trade with immunostains and you have to put it in order I mean if you have a fellow great but not everyone has the luxury of having of being a fellow so uh so you know somebody has to do that so the point of the matter is that all of that can be done just as well by the digital pathology workflow so these little things add up and make you a more efficient pathologist so it's just the reading science for the majority of cases will be quicker but also things like preparing for tumor boards uh teaching your Juniors your residents not wasting time looking for a slides etc etc all of these add up and make you more efficient pathologies

um then the question is about the soup Specialties one do you want to say something for the soup Specialties in our routine for example in the endoscopic biopsies you also mentioned about HP bacteria it's a high magnification we had problem with endoscopic biopsies and for example we didn't use gimsa stain for HP before digital but after the digital digitalization of the endoscopic biopsies we started to use gimsa stain for HP like this for which the subspecialties did you have problems or which Solutions Solutions yeah so so you know Finding bacterias is definitely more challenging in digital pathology for the reasons that you mentioned one thing that in my opinion works really well is uh instead of doing gimsa perhaps considering doing a silver stain like quoting story and the reason for that is that working story is being a silver stain provides greater contrast so the bacteria are easier to find than on the game set the problem is that you know digital pathology scanners rely on contrast to to digitize the slides and for this reason the gimsa in my opinion is not the ideal staying for finding bacteria whereas the wording story that actually provides high contrast it's it's definitely much preferable in my opinion to to find helicobacter and gastric biopsies so definitely you know there are a number of little tricks of the trade that you led with experience and and perhaps you know preferring Walden story staying for stomach biopsies as opposed to games so maybe something worth trying and see see what your experience is there but I think it's definitely worth to to go yeah what about your experience in hematopathology Center in English not biopsy for example in the diagnosis of lymphomas yeah so in that sense you know one thing that is is quite you know welcomed by Pathologists is the ability to essentially split your screen in four different quadrants and in one quadrant you can have your h e and in the other three quadrants you can have CD3 cd5 you know C20 whatever markers you want to have and essentially viewing the immunomarker expression in the different regions of the lymph node and refer that with the h e is actually quite quite useful really so so that is something that hematopatholics actually love in reality because it makes your life a lot easier visualizing different Expressions all at once all at the same time in the microscope the way that is thrown is that you try to not forget the region of Interest while you quickly swap the slides trying to find the city that you want to compare with very quickly before you forget the region of Interest in a digital workflow this is more efficient because essentially you overlay or you compare the different techniques together and your attention gets to the right Point all the time which more is and more efficiently so so yeah your your answer was different than IX

resistance was at the Hamilton pathology side I will share your experience that uh it is better because a big magnification and uh our I used the microscope microtune so much so not suitable for hematopathology was one of the feedbacks I get and um I had a little resistance at digital translation but one of the feedbacks was like that thank you and and other from our team thank you very much for the Visionary presentation I have been working entirely digitally for the last year from home I validated with 60 cases but it took me about five months to feel completely comfortable and I checked myself with a microscope for three to four months in some cases I feel really safe right now after one year I have two questions about validation one what are your qualitative and quantitative recommendations for the transition process two is there a need for a legal regulation or certification for validation so so essentially I would say that you know both questions could be could be answered really by uh the existing recommendations from the College of American Pathologists which essentially required that a validation process is performed before the adoption of digital pathology for uh for scale so essentially the cap recommends that at least 60 cases that were diagnosed primarily on the microscope get reviewed again on a digital format to try to quantify the number of discrepancies of diagnostic discrepancies and that should definitely be you know the recommendation when starting to to go digital does that mean that with 60 cases you're going to be confident depends you know some people feel confident with even fewer cases some people require more cases I think we should differentiate here between you know validation which is making sure the diagnostic discrepancies are reasonable and are kept under control and a different thing is actually training in other words because again humans are different you know some people feel more confident you know sooner than others whereas some other people need you know greater exposure to different things before they still they start feeling more confident so so when it comes to validation certainly cfp provides you know useful guidelines but we shouldn't be afraid to actually train in Greater volumes until we feel sufficiently confident

okay and we want to say and something about lack of Regulation or certification for validation um so so in principle at the moment there is nothing in that regard the only thing the only requirement really is uh the uh the validation when implementing digital pathology so as long as you follow the CFE guidelines and document you know the number of discrepancies you should you should be okay but so far there are no other legal requirements prior to implementing that in the United States you had to have a clear certification actually if you wanted to sign out cases from home but since the covet pandemic this has been an exception an exception that basically has been prolonged today so certainly there are no further regulations all the time you know the cap validation when it comes to implementing digital pathology uh for routine diagnosis yes and yes I think time is needed for the regulations and the standardization I think another question Juan all sun or Han asks can you elaborate on the FDA approval process for your AI Solutions yep so the topic of another speech maybe it's definitely the total for another session but but essentially you know the FDA was um there were a series of elements here the first element is that the AI is not supposed to be used autonomously the AI is supposed to be used in conjunction as an adjunct to a pathologist so that is the first the first element the second element is how this information is presented to the pathologist so first of all the pathologist is supposed to look at the slide inform their assessment activate the AI and then contrast their diagnosis with that proposed by the AI and the reason for that is that sometimes you know pathologies Miss small fossil of tumor that get totally uh overlooked so the idea is that I enriched my diagnosis activate the AI and then corroborate my diagnosis with that proposed by the AI so but remember the AI is not gospel it's not the word of God it's basically Another Touch point of information it's just another challenge and you just like you know no different 20 minutes time sometimes you know we reach a provisional diagnosis request the immunostains and some of the immunos do not match our preferred diagnosis so what we do is that we put everything into context and we reach a preferred diagnosis for the you know for the situation that we are facing artificial intelligence should be no different in that regard so that is the second point the artificial intelligence is not jumped to the pathologist the third element is that the AI has to generalize very well and by generalization what we mean is that in machine learning terms is that it's robust to domain shifts in other words when you train AI you use a series of data when you test that AI in data that are similar to that in which we'll strain the expectation is that the performance will be similar what happens however when you expose the AI to data that are very dissimilar very different to those in which it was trained how robust is it by that what we mean is you know data pertaining to Patient variables like age gender race etc etc pre-analytical factors staining fixation times section thickness etc etc and also the user variables like you know does AI affect pathologies with more experience more or less than authorities with less experience so you know all of these variables uh basically are covered under the term you know generalizability how West how well does the AI actually generalize in different patients different populations different pre-analyticals and different uses so these were the three main pillars upon which you know the AI sorry the FDA examine AI performance prior to providing authorization okay thank you all another question from jerem Voyage do Pathologists at your clinic have the same experience with transactions basements as they have its biopsies on the digital pathology workflow yes yes because because essentially every single case was digitized from 2016 every single one including biopsies resections and of course you know it's a Public Health Care system which means that we have to cover all sorts um you know including biopsies including lateral sections all Medical Specialties you know including you know from head and neck to soft tissue absolutely everything you know pediatric pathology medical kidney absolutely everything and everything was digitized and you know very very few slides were still uh review another microscope so so suddenly you know reviewing every case digital is is indeed possible more than possible and it's highly recommended yes thank you another question from Karam Kai Han uh ambitious studies on bright fields are being all over the world and they are successful besides how do you approach any of the sound cases and also especially virtual staining 3D models

yeah so so essentially you know 3D models it's something that you know still today is is more in the realm of experimental pathology but not really seeing in in protein practice if what we mean by 3D model is actually having a set access so in other words we have the x-axis the y-axis and the set axis which at the end of the day is what Pathologists have with the micrometers we can actually play with a different uh thickness of the preparation if we will this is something that you know most routine digital pathology scanners do not have today but you know it is a matter of time before we have you know set access um so so that is as far as you know three-dimensional pathology is is involved personally beyond that seems to be outside you know the routine clinical use at this at this point in time

thank you Juan another question from my uh one of my old friends again if you have any experience about application of AI in practice of a pathology residence education program yeah that is a great question because you know there is two schools of thought here one is that what happens with Pilots when they get trained in Flight School they don't start flying with autopilot when they when they are learning right instead what they do is that they have to learn with a small airplane and eventually they graduate into a bigger airplane more complex that eventually has autopilot amongst you know many other things is that how we want to train our residents do we want our residents to feel comfortable on a microscope without using any AIDS in my opinion that's probably the right way to do it however also there is Great Value in you know teaching residents to use artificial intelligence and this should be incorporated into the training syllabus early because at the end of the day this is something that is happening today and obviously in an Ideal World we want to train our residents to be able to use artificial intelligence you know as is intended you know jump to the pathologist to be able to make a judicious use of the outputs that the AI is giving us and to be able to put into context whatever the AI is telling us so all of this has to be incorporated into the training syllabus but of course you know there is no substitute for you know training our residents to use the microscope with proficiency and with confidence okay

it's AI in residency vld cutoff speed changed or will what we are used to maybe a little change will happen with AI but change is the only thing that doesn't change I think yes change change is the early constant for sure in my opinion in my opinion you can certainly you know expose the residents to more cases with artificial intelligence than without because you know I mean how do you explain what lesson three and lesson 4 is unless you have an attending pointing out specific areas on every glass slide you know we're all humans and we all have time constraints we're all under pressure so you know the The Faculty can only spend so much time pointing out what is a region of glizen 3 in this slide but the AI does not have those constraints so you know perhaps residents can take you know some homework at home at night activate the AI look at some slides and see all right this is what is meant by glisten free this is what it's meant by listen for this is actually an area of lesson five that the AI is highlighted for me so it will facilitate exposing residents to a greater amounts of cases without needing to be you know actually supervised uh constantly by by the attorney of course you know the tenant will have to provide supervision but you know in order to memorize certain patterns AI can be very very helpful perhaps you know assessing lymph nodes um you know sometimes it's challenging to find a micromat but the AI can do that you know in a fraction of a second so this uh little challenges can we propose to Residents as part of the training and I think you know making it more enjoyable and and quite useful let me experience in my opinion with AI and digital pathology pathology became more amazing for the young Pathologists and they are they like it more they like pathology more of it uh it is it's a good point of that I think yes because because you don't have to be pestering anyone to show you what lesson 5 looks like right you just basically open up a case click a button and you know that is that is you're not bothering you're attending if you will and I guess you know some trainees are very conscious the time pressures that everyone is under and they don't want to put more burden so perhaps you know having AI as an additional resource I think I think is quite welcomed by by the trainees so so yeah totally share your point there also for joint fiction join six children AI is so good I agree yes another question from our uh honoring uh pathologist Iden Sal thanks for your comprehensive and eye-opening talk may I learn your impression of the future of digital transformation I will go on one by one one first is this feature of digital transformation

so I think you know um we talk about digital pathology today I think in the next five to ten years we're just gonna call it pathology you know a few years ago we talked about mobile phones today we don't say mobile phones today we say our phone right where is my phone right I've just got a phone call we don't talk about mobile phones anymore for the most part and I think something similar is going to happen to digital pathology perhaps you know in a similar timeline so from digital pathology we're gonna go to Just pathology in other words digital pathology should become mainstream within the next few years because you know we know it works um and you know there's early adopters you know in in the five continents basically proving that it's doable that is possible and uh and that you can do it and and yeah and and you're gonna you're gonna survive right and not only that also you're gonna Thrive you're going to be your colleagues are gonna thank you um because you know it's a more flexible it's a preferred alternative to the microscope you're no longer bound to show up to the hospital show up to the laboratory to pay homage to the Temple of pathology you can you can work from home if you have you know small kids a young family it provides additional flexibility so you know for all of these reasons uh your colleagues are going to be thankful that you Embark in this in this transformation journey and therefore pathology digital pathology will become pathology just mainstream that is my my vision for the future okay the the next question what are the limits of AI my understanding is that AI I will not substitute main power namely Pathologists but will be used extensively by whom those who welcome the concept of digital transformation yeah I think I think that's largely accurate so again you know this is the topic for another talk in the future but as we mentioned earlier um you know AI is is meant to be an assistant to the pathologist and let's jump to the pathologies no different than to an immunostane of course it's a sophisticated uh you know uh adjunct if you will but it has to be put into context because nothing is perfect in life and AI is no exception so autonomous AI is is still not in the cards for for many decades so we shouldn't be afraid of losing our jobs anytime soon you know of course you know I guess this is the last one

get rid of our pains back pains and others right right yeah so no but that is a great point because you know the repetitive menial tasks like you know counting Counting mitosis quantifying chi-67 uh finding micromats in a lymph node AI can do that much better for you one thing that AI cannot do is put things into context and this is something that we as the human brain does very well so we take you know the sailing elements of morphology immunostochemistry quantification molecular we put all of that into context and we put that in our reports this is something that we do incredibly well but the machine cannot do that yet but you know this is this is the reason why we're not going to be uh left unemployed by the technology anytime soon yes a good assistance is good

molecular biomarkers if so how this will be achieved yeah that is a great question because at the end of the day you know we have increasing evidence that certain mutants correspond to a certain phenotype in other words the mutational status of a cell will actually result in a phenotype that can be detected by the AI not all mutations result in that phenotypical change that can be detected but some of them are you know placing point is probably you know MSI and her2 we know that these two mutations can actually be detected by AI but at the end of the day what AIS is looking at is changes in phenotype which at the end of the day is what you want if you think about it because when you treat these patients uh with uh you know immunotherapy what you're treating is the phenotype you you don't treat the underlying mutation what you do treat is the is the phenotype the phenotypical alteration is what respond to treatment in other words this is a long convoluted way of saying that essentially Rudolph wilhof said it you know 150 years ago that no matter how you slice it and dice it you will always come back to the cell you will always come back to morphology and this is what we've seen again that you know there is a lot of information in the humble hne slide that can be extracted thanks to artificial intelligence these mutational status that obeys uh creates a certain phenotype many times can be detected by artificial intelligence and I think that's incredibly exciting because we're going full circle from you know uh from morphology to molecular back to morphology yes thank you AI will be so amazing to talk again with you one yeah we can we can share that we will have another session about AI but the questions uh show that everyone waits for AI another question from Raj Mirza Sultan you said that slide barcodes are very important for slide scanning how did you handle this problem I think on a laser slide printers can meet the stability a hundreds persons how did you achieve this standard here so so you know there are no hard on Fast rules my advice would once you get a digital pathology scanner test it and test it with your existing barcodes see how many error rate you get is that error rate something that you can manage perhaps you know if the error rate that you find is maybe five in a hundred that means that if you do you know houses lights every day you're gonna have 50 slides that are going to end up in limbo because they could not trigger The Interchange of information is that something you can manage because if it is something you can manage then probably you don't need to do anything else than that if the error rate however is 20 which means that you're going to end up with 200 slides every day been being sent to limbo then you probably need to do something about it so what can you do there well you know Laser Printers is definitely a solution but they're very expensive nothing nothing in life is perfect there's always a trade-off and uh you know if you want to have perfect barcodes you're probably going to end up with a very expensive printer but there are alternatives like right how about if we try if we try increasing the contrast setting in our printer will that result in fewer errors what if we try changing the actual um labels for you know those levels that have a plastic cover will those levels result in fewer errors if everything else fails then probably you can start thinking about you know testing with different printers ultimately you know the laser Predator is probably the the best solution because you know it etches on the on the slide itself on the glass which is very resistant it's very good quality but it's expensive right so again this there's no rights or wrong answer here it's a matter of trial and error many times until you find an error rate that you feel comfortable with I think we changed two to twice or three times the barcode readers uh to manage the the reading of the QR codes right try and see exactly our experience is like that also it may be maybe maybe that the Q the barcodes quality is already very good and you end up with an error rate of you know one in a hundred or or less well in that situation you don't need to do anything but you know it's definitely you know stress test the system try you know during the early implementation times you know get your scannering test it with you know large number of slides when we did this Sacramento we tested with 10 yeah 10 000 slides to see what scanning times would be to see what the error rate would be etc etc and then we acted accordingly so so no shame in playing around as long as you write down the results right uh but that's the scientific method at the end of the day so is to trial an error you want [Music]

our discussion is about storage and the archive the question is about the archive I would like to ask you about a very important point which is the digital archiving and its needs for store space as well as they work on the side of Information Technology teammates how did you find the working

sustainable solution thank you yeah so so you know archive can come in many many flavors so you know the early adopters did not use cloud because you know back in those days Cloud was still not a viable option or it was very expensive so a lot of what the early adopters did was to to buy on-premises storage so large service to keep everything on premises today cloud is actually cheaper and more viable solution than what it was you know five ten years ago um you know the beauty of cloud is that essentially it does require little upfront investment that it is accessible from everywhere and that essentially you can buy as you need right so those those are the you know the two points that you have to balance on-prem versus cloud again certainly the cloud offers flexibility and advantages that you know you do not have with on-premises deployments so so definitely you know having a Cloud solution is is is is definitely recommended another thing to bear in mind is right what happens with very long-term archival Solutions can this be made on premises it can be made on premises so the question is to try and find you know a cloud provider that basically suits your needs in terms of you know short medium and very long term storage and see whether a combination of cloud on-premises is is doable perhaps you decide that everything can be sent to the cloud perhaps you decide that everything can be actually uh you know stored in premise so again no hard and fast rules but you know cloud is definitely a better solution than what it was five years ago

thank you Juan I can ask a question Roy in pathology means region of interest but for digital pathology return of investment is also a great challenge in digital pathology um can you say something because in Turkey uh you in Granada University was a public hospital I'm working in a private hospital and in Turkey we are discussing how the find the money for digital pathology and return of Investments would you say something about that yeah that is there is a very controversial point because you know um essentially with digital pathology what you're going to achieve is an increase of efficiency in the in the pathologies that that you have now this some pathology say well you know if I'm going to be 20 more efficient um I should be paid 20 more right because you know I'm seeing 20 more cases so I I should be you know compensated accordingly suddenly what we did in our medium in in our situation was that there were a number of retirements that were not replaced uh on purpose and essentially because we couldn't find suitable candidates so essentially what that meant is that the existing pathologies were able to cope with increasing workloads which basically saved money to the to the public Institution now the question is if you prolong you know these savings when do you recover your investment and in our experience you know the investment can be recovered um you know usually anywhere between the second and the third year following implementation but of course you have to be fully digital for that right so essentially if you assume that the the life the typical life of uh you know scanner is five years that means that you recover your investment between the second and the third year and you still have two additional years in which the scanner will be saving money so this is how the return investment comes into place um but essentially it hinges largely on the gain deficiency by the pathologist the ability of your pathology is of increasing you know the the productivity that is that is in our experience how you Justified investment doesn't mean that the pathology is will not be compensated for the extra effort no I think you know everybody should be compensated fairly and you know there is an efficiency gain there can we split here the difference and we actually split the difference you know some of it to be reflected back to the pathologies some of it to be reflected back to an institution I think that would be the fair thing to do right because at the end of the day if you assume greater responsibility that should be reflected on on your compensation as well but essentially this is this is the dialogue that needs to be had and uh and the point where the return on investment calculation has to be made

okay thank you Juan another question asks what are the challenges you have faced when using this system on cytopathologists basements I'm concerned on the probable problems especially with the Congressional non-gynecological smears yeah yeah so in reality the all the clinical grade scanners he used today um all of them who have the FDA approval essentially are approved for uh histopathology only for tissue-based pathology everything else so cytology the problem there is that cytology can be a distributed in a three-dimensional uh situation which means that you need a set axis scanner the problem with said access scanners is that you know they take longer to digitize and the resulting file size is going to be very large so because essentially you are digitizing several slices whereas with a histology it's kind of used digitizing a single plane with a sexual scanner you'll be digitizing several planes in order for the the entire cytology to be in focus so that means that today is not very practical yes to the Enterprise cytology because you know the scanning times are very very long and the file size of the resulting file is actually huge is massive so for this reason um many early adopters are opted for keep cytology everything cytology based on the digital world sorry on the glass workflow so that is the rationale for that so cytology today are not that practical yet you know still you know it is not long before it will be resolved but today it's still not doable

according to your experience how many digital slides should be read by a practicing pathologist without having a risk of making a major diagnostic mistake I mean what is the optimal number of slides per pathologist in your digital pathology practice both for optimal workloads and not making any mistakes thank you so I think I think that really depends again on the individual pathologist I mean you see some Pathologists in private practice in the United States who see very large volume of slides which is very different to what you see in pathology's breathing in in academic institutions so you know I'm afraid I do not have a magical number but this is no different to what it would be on the glass workflow it is no different in that sense so we all have a limit as human beings and we know that the human concentration is not infinite and we know that we all get distracted I'm tired eventually so we all have individual limits so so therefore it's very difficult to put you know a general recommendation that would be valid for everyone what is valid for a private pathologist is very different than that for an academic pathologist and and we know that so so you know glass has limitations and and detail is no different in that regards workload is a big problem uh to solve in pathology because you cannot put the at the same thing every case or for example the number of the slides can be uh measure of the workloads no a true cut biopsy sometimes makes us to work on for for a week for example then you can sign out a resection of 100 blocks in one hour so so the workload is the problem in pathology and digital pathology doesn't solve it you'll say yeah it will make you more efficient you will waste less time looking for slides you know taking measurements counting mitosis but you know every everyone has a limit and you know digital pathology will help you perhaps stretch that limit a little bit but it won't do any Miracles I'm afraid so yeah yes uh thank you Juan our time is uh 2014. uh time passed so fast we do we have time we can have some questions and I can share that Juan will be with us with an uh other session about Ai and prostate algorithms and breast algorithms they worked on later on uh on these webinars uh thank you Juan to join us to share your experience it was it was so great and amazing I listened to you so many times but it was uh just as it was the first time that I listened to you thank you so very tiny it was my pleasure to be here and I can thank you enough for the invitation it was really very enjoyable experience so looking forward to the next one okay there's none for us to host you here thank you very much for your uh kind experience sharing your experience with us and it was really a kind of eye-opening for us especially for the Pathologists like me who has not much experience on digital pathology thank you very much absolute pleasure okay this is the end of our first session uh

um

the questions are they're so good I I think that one what do you think I don't know and it was so amazing to have so much questions so so different questions from every size so it was amazing for me to with all of the audiences with you so thank you very much our next webinar is on July June July end of July and we will share the program later on and we will be so happy one if the English webinars we can invite you for the others so thank you very much thank you very much foreign
