### Pancreas:

# Discussion Points

- Are AI models file type agnostic? (.svs, .tiff, .ndpi) 
- Are AI models PACS agnostic? 
- Will there be different environments for models? (similar to iOS vs android, windows vs mac vs linux) 
- Where are the analysis performed? 
  - Where is the GPU power run? Locally, Cloud? 
- How are the files transferred? 
- Which additional information (metadata) should be transferred? 
- How is security managed? 
- HIPAA, KVKK
- Where are the results stored? 
- How long are the results stored? 
- Are the results embedded into the original image? 
- Is it possible to rerun the model? 
- If there is an update into the model, what happens if the original interpratation changes? 
- When are the analysis done? Prior to the review by pathologist or if pathologist triggers?
- Do we need FDA or IVD approval for all models? Regarding that most IHC clones are 'research only'
