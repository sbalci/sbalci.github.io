# Introduction

It is a very common bibliometric study type to retrospectively analyse the number of peer reviewed articles written from a country to view the amount of contribution made in a specific scientific discipline.

These studies require too much effort, since the data is generally behind paywalls and restrictions.

I have previously contributed to a research to identify the Articles from Turkey Published in Pathology Journals Indexed in International Indexes; which is published here: [Turk Patoloji Derg. 2010, 26(2):107-113 doi: 10.5146/tjpath.2010.01006](http://www.turkjpath.org/summary_en.php3?id=1423) 

This study had required manual investigation of many excel files, which was time consuming; also redoing and updating the data and results require a similar amount of effort.

# Analysis

---

## Country Based Comparison

To see the analysis comparing number of pathology articles from Turkey, German and Japan see this analysis: [Country Based Comparison](https://sbalci.github.io/pubmed/CountryBasedComparison.html)

---

## Articles per Journals per Country

In this analysis we aimed to compare number articles per journals per country. We tried to identify if articles from a country is published in certain journals: [Articles Per Journals Per Country](https://sbalci.github.io/pubmed/ArticlesPerJournalsPerCountry.html)

## Most Common MeSH Terms and Keywords used in Pathology Articles from Turkey

In this analysis we aimed to identify the common research topics Turkish pathologists are interested. We extracted most common MeSH terms and keywords from PubMed articles using EDirect:
